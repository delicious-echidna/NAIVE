NAIVE offers a streamlined approach to network inventory by providing users with an accessible tool to generate a comprehensive inventory of devices connected to their subnet. Utilizing ARP scans, MAC vendor lookups, and DNS requests, NAIVE can collect detailed information about every device connected to the current subnet. This system is designed to alleviate the burden traditional asset inventorying poses since it automatically creates an asset .JSON file compatible with Tenableâ€™s asset importation process, CSVs, and a print format. By achieving this level of automation, NAIVE aims to assist enterprises in adhering to NIST and CIS standards for network inventory management by enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of their network inventory.
